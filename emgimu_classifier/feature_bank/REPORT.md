# Feature Bank + Personal Calibration — interim evidence

This is an incomplete execution of the two supplied specifications, not a completion claim.
All reported evaluations use held-out subjects or sessions. Final families and calibration
hyperparameters were selected on validation data; final data was not used to tune them.
Seed: 20260915. Classical logistic regression runs use CPU; no neural training is needed
for these representation comparisons.

## Independent test results

| Dataset / failure | F0 macro-F1 | Frozen bank macro-F1 | Bank |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| UniBo / days 7–8 | 0.7044 | 0.7102 | F0 + temporal |
| Electrode Shift / subjects 18–20 | 0.4912 | 0.5478 | F0 + ring geometry |
| MANUS / session 3 | 0.4453 | 0.4718 | F0 + SPD tangent |
| EMG-FMG / loads 250–1000 g, subjects 4–6 | 0.6239 | 0.6530 | F0 + spectral |
| EMG-FMG / positions 2–8, subjects 4–6 | 0.6112 | 0.6307 | F0 + SPD tangent |

UniBo posture 2, its hardest posture cell, improves from 0.6638 to 0.6788.
EMG-FMG load log-loss improves from 0.8356 to 0.7420 and position log-loss from
1.1270 to 0.9889. MANUS SPD improves F1 but worsens log-loss (1.5920 → 1.7535),
so it cannot be called an unconditional improvement.

## Personal calibration

| Final protocol | 0 trials/class | 1 | 2 | 5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| LibEMG force / F0+CSP+X1H with anchor fusion | 0.5860 | 0.5845 | 0.6038 | unsupported |
| EPN612 / F0+ring weighted fine-tune | 0.4386 | 0.4298 | 0.4419 | 0.4653 |
| MANUS / F0+SPD session fine-tune, mean per-user F1 | 0.4161 | 0.6861 | 0.6065 | unsupported |

Force has four trials/class/condition (MVC two); MANUS has three speed trials/class/session.
Unsupported budgets are explicit rows, not estimated scores. Calibration trials are removed
from evaluation and their IDs are saved in calibration run manifests. MANUS two-shot leaves
only one trial/class and has considerable sampling uncertainty. Its per-user mean F1 is a
different aggregation from the pooled screening F1 and should not be directly subtracted.

EPN prototype-anchor calibration failed on validation: 0.4169 → 0.4142 / 0.3996 /
0.3706 for 1/2/5 trials. This negative result is retained. Weighted fine-tuning was subsequently
frozen on validation (C=0.1, total calibration weight 15/class) before final evaluation.

## Screening and interactions

LibEMG force validation F0 is 0.5478. F0+CSP reaches 0.6256; adding X1H reaches
0.6446. Adding all four screened specialists yields 0.6430 with worse log-loss.
The full bank and leave-one-family-out evidence therefore do not support indiscriminate stacking.
Conditional deltas and pairwise error complementarity are in the accompanying CSVs.
They are held-out validation comparisons, not nested cross-validation estimates.

F9 quality weighting under synthetic motion bursts improves log-loss 1.4638 → 1.2203
but lowers F1 0.5109 → 0.5016. Synthetic corruption is not evidence of real hardware robustness.
No public benchmark proves the current eight-channel device will recognize open/pinch/fist
reliably without device-specific labelled calibration and live evaluation.

## Scope, dimensions and reproducibility

The six Tier-1 archives are complete and hashes are recorded in the discovery manifest.
EPN experiments use trainingJSON users 1–21; labelled testingSamples are unavailable and
Myo detections are never treated as ground truth. MANUS uses users 3–8 and six flexext gestures.
Electrode Shift uses validation subjects 15–17 and final 18–20; EMG-FMG uses validation
1–3 and final 4–6. These are bounded studies, not full-cohort evaluations of 612/27 users.
UniBo uses native four named-muscle channels and excludes cyclic-ring assumptions.
EMG-FMG uses columns 9–16 (EMG), excludes FMG, and samples eight windows from the central
nine seconds of each 18-second recording; this crop is an analysis assumption.

Feature dimensions are recorded per model in `results/feature_family_results.csv` and
run manifests. F2 uses covariance trace normalization, CSP train-fit filters and shrinkage
SPD tangent references. X1H retains normalized channel power and cross-channel structure.
F3 combines relative log-channel structure, cyclic energy statistics and covariance.
F4 summarizes spectral bands; F5 uses within-window temporal summaries. These implementations
are new reference implementations; equivalence to unavailable historical DS2 formulas is unproven.

`benchmarks/consolidate_feature_bank.py` rebuilds the five result tables with source run IDs
and SHA-256 provenance. Small JSON manifests are copied alongside the tables. The audited
force validation run additionally stores family pickle states, held-out probability arrays,
split trial IDs, and train-standardized nuisance/gesture centroid distances. Treat pickle
files as trusted local artifacts only. Raw archives remain outside Git.

## Remaining specification work

Historical DS2 is blocked: no exact historical artifacts were found and the original Kaggle
release returned 404. NinaPro requires access; secondary datasets remain explicitly deferred.
EMG-FMG and UniBo now each have six-trial QC and six raw/envelope/PSD plots.
F8 session signature, DTW templates and personal normalization are implemented and unit-tested
but their full comparative experiments are not complete. Required prediction/state persistence
is currently strongest for audited force screening; other runners need the same coverage.
Per-family calibration gain, diagnostics across all failures, complete shortlist/full-bank
ablation across datasets, and an integrated robustness vector remain to be completed.

Verification so far: 96 unittest tests passed, one skipped. This report and the active goal
remain open until those requirements and Git delivery are verified.

## Shrinkage late fusion follow-up

EPN uses independent F0 and ring classifiers with uniform population weights. Personal
weights use calibration-trial prototype separation divided by within-class dispersion,
softmax temperature 1 and population shrinkage n0=8. Both classifiers and all family/scaler
states are fit on users 1–15; reliability is fit only on explicit calibration trials.
The validation and final runs store fitted states, selected trial IDs and held-out predictions.
Final mean per-user F1 for uniform/personal fusion is 0.4690/0.4711 at two trials and
0.4780/0.4729 at five trials. Five-trial personal fusion improves log-loss 1.4425 → 1.4258
while lowering F1. This is a limited specialist-fusion experiment, not the full-bank solution.
Uniform scores change with calibration budget because the same calibration trials are removed
from both methods; those changes alone must not be interpreted as calibration gains.
